23335766	10,11-Dehydrocurvularin is a prevalent fungal phytotoxin with heat shock response and immune-modulatory activities. It features a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid lactone polyketide framework with structural similarities to resorcylic acid lactones like radicicol or zearalenone. A genomic locus was identified from the dehydrocurvularin producer strain Aspergillus terreus AH-02-30-F7 to reveal genes encoding a pair of iterative polyketide synthases (A. terreus CURS1 [AtCURS1] and AtCURS2) that are predicted to collaborate in the biosynthesis of 10,11-dehydrocurvularin. Additional genes in this locus encode putative proteins that may be involved in the export of the compound from the cell and in the transcriptional regulation of the cluster. 10,11-Dehydrocurvularin biosynthesis was reconstituted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by heterologous expression of the polyketide synthases. Bioinformatic analysis of the highly reducing polyketide synthase AtCURS1 and the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 highlights crucial biosynthetic programming differences compared to similar synthases involved in resorcylic acid lactone biosynthesis. These differences lead to the synthesis of a predicted tetraketide starter unit that forms part of the 12-membered lactone ring of dehydrocurvularin, as opposed to the penta- or hexaketide starters in the 14-membered rings of resorcylic acid lactones. Tetraketide N-acetylcysteamine thioester analogues of the starter unit were shown to support the biosynthesis of dehydrocurvularin and its analogues, with yeast expressing AtCURS2 alone. Differential programming of the product template domain of the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 results in an aldol condensation with a different regiospecificity than that of resorcylic acid lactones, yielding the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid scaffold characterized by an S-type cyclization pattern atypical for fungal polyketides. 
20947616	10-((4-Hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)methyl)chromeno[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3(2H)-one (E7016), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is being developed for anticancer therapy. One of the major metabolites identified in preclinical animal studies was the product of an apparent oxidation and ring opening of the 4-hydroxypiperidine. In vitro, this oxidized metabolite could not be generated by incubating E7016 with animal or human liver microsomes. Further studies revealed the formation of this unique metabolite in hepatocytes. In a NAD(P)(+)-dependent manner, this metabolite was also generated by liver S9 fractions and recombinant human flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) 5 that was fortified with liver cytosol fractions. In animal and human liver S9, this metabolic pathway could be inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole, bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate (BNPP), or a brief heat treatment at 50degreesC. Based on these results, the overall metabolic pathway was believed to involve a two-step oxidation process: dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohol in liver cytosol followed by an FMO5-mediated Baeyer-Villiger oxidation in liver microsomes. The two oxidation steps were coupled via regeneration of NAD(P)(+) and NAD(P)H. To further confirm this mechanism, the proposed ketone intermediate was independently synthesized. In an NAD(P)H-dependent manner, the synthetic ketone intermediate was metabolized to the same ring-opened metabolite in animal and human liver microsomes. This metabolic reaction was also inhibited by BNPP or a brief heat treatment at 50degreesC. Methimazole, the substrate/inhibitor of FMO1 and FMO3, did not inhibit this reaction. The specificity of FMO5 toward catalyzing this Baeyer-Villiger oxidation was further demonstrated by incubating the synthetic ketone intermediate in recombinant enzymes. 
3392008	10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) catalyzes the NADP-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. Previous studies of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase purified from rat or pig liver homogenized in phosphate buffers indicated the presence of copurifying 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity, which catalyzes conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and formate. We find that the supernatant from rat liver homogenized in mannitol/sucrose/EDTA medium contains essentially all of the total cellular 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, but no measurable hydrolase activity. Treating mannitol/sucrose/EDTA-washed mitochondria with Triton X-100 (0.5%) releases hydrolase activity in soluble form. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase purified from the mannitol/sucrose/EDTA supernatant has no 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity. Results of kinetic experiments using the hydrolase-free dehydrogenase give a complex rate equation with respect to (6R,S)-10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Double-reciprocal plots fit a 2/1 hyperbolic function with apparent Km values of 3.9 and 68 microM. Our results indicate that 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase and dehydrogenase are not alternate catalytic activities of a single protein, but represent two closely related and separately compartmentalized hepatic enzymes.
